# Twilio's request to your incoming message Webhook URL

When an incoming message arrives at your Twilio phone number, Twilio sends a request to your web application via a [webhook](/docs/usage/webhooks/messaging-webhooks) request. This request contains information about the incoming message, such as its sender and any attached media. Your application can store this data or use it for customizing a response, for example.

Twilio makes HTTP requests to your application, just like a regular web browser, in the format `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. By including parameters and values in its requests, Twilio sends data to your application that you can act upon before responding.

You can configure the URLs and HTTP Methods Twilio uses to make its requests via your [account portal in the Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) or using the [REST API](/docs/messaging/api).

Twilio cannot cache `POST` requests. If you want Twilio to cache static TwiML pages, then configure Twilio to make requests to your application using `GET`.

> \[!CAUTION]
>
> The parameters included in StatusCallback events vary by channel and event type and are subject to change in the future. Twilio will occasionally add new parameters without advance notice. When integrating with webhooks, it is important that your implementation is able to accept and correctly run signature validation on an evolving set of parameters. We strongly recommend using the provided [signature validation](/docs/usage/webhooks/webhooks-security) library from a Twilio SDK and not implementing your own signature validation.

## Parameters in Twilio's Request to your Application

When Twilio receives a message at one of your Twilio numbers, RCS sender, or a [WhatsApp](/docs/whatsapp)-enabled number, it makes a synchronous HTTP request to the message URL configured for that number or [Messaging Service](/docs/messaging/services) and expects to receive [TwiML](/docs/messaging/twiml) in response.

Twilio sends the following parameters with its request as `POST` parameters or URL query parameters, depending on which HTTP method you've configured:

For messages that are replies to a specific message sent in the previous 7 days, Twilio will send these additional parameters:

### Status Callbacks

In the context of Twilio documentation, status callbacks (and the webhooks configured for these) generally refer to events raised by the lifecycle of **outgoing** messages, rather than incoming messages as discussed on this page. Although incoming messages can theoretically also raise status callback events, the statues involved here can only be `receiving` (a very transitory state) or `received`; if an incoming message has failed to be received by Twilio or has not yet been received, then by definition Twilio cannot raise an event for such a message. Thus, incoming-message status callbacks have very little practical application. On the other hand, outgoing messages will change their status repeatedly throughout an entire lifecycle, and these status changes can be tracked by means of status callbacks and webhooks configured to receive them. For more information on outgoing-message status callbacks and webhooks, see [this guide](/docs/messaging/guides/outbound-message-status-in-status-callbacks).
